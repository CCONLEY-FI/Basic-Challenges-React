### thank you to https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json for providing a much faster way to spawn valid words... check out wordGenerator.js if you want to laugh at my attempt to bruteforce a DB :

### ReactJS Training Tool: Code Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Hello World Component

- **Objective**: Create a basic React component that displays "Hello, World!".
- **Key Concepts**: Basic React component structure, JSX.

#### Challenge 2: Stateful Counter Component

- **Objective**: Create a component with a button that increments a counter displayed on the screen.
- **Key Concepts**: State management with `useState`, handling events.

#### Challenge 3: Dynamic List Rendering

- **Objective**: Render a list of items (strings) dynamically from an array in the state.
- **Key Concepts**: Rendering lists, using the `map` function.

#### Challenge 4: Controlled Form Component

- **Objective**: Build a form with an input field and a submit button. On submission, display the input value below the form.
- **Key Concepts**: Controlled components, form handling.

#### Challenge 5: Component Props and Data Flow

- **Objective**: Create a parent component that passes data to a child component via props. The child component should display this data.
- **Key Concepts**: Props, component hierarchy.

#### Challenge 6: Lifting State Up

- **Objective**: Two sibling components should communicate with each other through a shared state in their parent component.
- **Key Concepts**: Lifting state up, callback functions as props.

#### Challenge 7: Conditional Rendering

- **Objective**: Display a component or message conditionally based on a state variable (e.g., show/hide a component with a button).
- **Key Concepts**: Conditional rendering, ternary operator, logical AND.

#### Challenge 8: Simple Todo Application

- **Objective**: Create a basic todo application where users can add items to a list and see them displayed.
- **Key Concepts**: Combining state, events, list rendering.

#### Challenge 9: Fetching Data from an API

- **Objective**: Fetch data from an API (like JSONPlaceholder) and display it in a component.
- **Key Concepts**: Using `useEffect` for side effects, fetching data, async/await.

#### Challenge 10: Context API for Theme Switching

- **Objective**: Implement a theme switcher using the Context API. The theme should apply across multiple components.
- **Key Concepts**: Context API, providing and consuming context.

### How to Use This Tool:

- **Progression**: Start from Challenge 1 and progress sequentially.
- **Documentation**: Refer to the official React documentation for guidance.
- **Testing**: After completing each challenge, test your component to ensure it works as expected.
- **Reflection**: After each challenge, reflect on what you've learned and how you might apply it in a real-world scenario.

By working through these challenges, you'll get hands-on experience with key React concepts, which will solidify your understanding and prepare you for more advanced topics and projects. Feel free to modify or extend these challenges to suit your learning style!
